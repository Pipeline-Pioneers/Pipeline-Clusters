## 🏃‍♂️ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run these commands to do different tasks:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode to ensure everything is working just fine. 🧑‍💻

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. Your app will be optimized for performance, and you're ready to deploy it anywhere! 🌍
